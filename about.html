        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> Hi Everyone! My name is Nate and I am a computer science student. I have been studying computer science for about
        18 months at this point, and am finally embarking on my journey to learn web development. I am proficient in C++ and Python,
        and am learning Java. I also have experience using MySQL with databases, and PYthon and R for data science work.
        </p>
        <p>I am looking to take a role as a developer in the next 12 months, as well as enrolling in a masters program in the
        next 12 months, either at Georgia Tech (OMSCS) or USC.</p>
